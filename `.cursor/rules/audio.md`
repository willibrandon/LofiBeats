# Audio Processing Rules

When working with audio processing code:

1. Use NAudio for Windows, consider CSCore for cross-platform
2. Always dispose audio resources properly
3. Use buffer sizes that are powers of 2
4. Consider performance implications of audio processing
5. Handle potential audio device errors gracefully
6. Use floating-point audio samples (-1.0 to 1.0 range)
7. Consider latency in real-time processing
