# General Project Rules

This is a .NET 9 Lofi Beats Generator project following clean architecture principles. When providing code:

1. Always use C# 13/.NET 9 features where appropriate
2. Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
3. Format all responses in markdown
4. When showing code edits, include enough context (like function/class names) but minimize showing unchanged code
5. Prefer async/await patterns for I/O operations
6. Use nullable reference types
7. Include XML documentation comments on public APIs

Reference Architecture:
- LofiBeats.Cli - Command line interface
- LofiBeats.Core - Core domain logic
- LofiBeats.Service - Web API
- LofiBeats.Tests - Test project
