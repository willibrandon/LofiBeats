# Performance Rules

1. Audio Processing:
   - Use buffer pooling for audio data
   - Minimize allocations in audio pipeline
   - Use SIMD operations where possible
   - Profile hot paths regularly

2. Memory Management:
   - Use ArrayPool<T> for temporary buffers
   - Implement object pooling for frequent allocations
   - Avoid boxing in audio processing code
   - Use Span<T>/Memory<T> for buffer operations

3. Threading:
   - Keep audio thread free of blocking operations
   - Use lock-free algorithms where possible
   - Proper synchronization of state changes
   - Monitor thread pool usage

4. Real-time Considerations:
   - Minimize garbage collection impact
   - Use high-precision timing
   - Monitor audio glitches
   - Handle device latency properly
