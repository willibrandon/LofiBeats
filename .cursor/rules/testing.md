# Testing Rules

For test files:

1. Use xUnit as the testing framework
2. Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario
4. Mock external dependencies (especially audio I/O)
5. Keep tests focused and atomic
6. Use Theory for parameterized tests
7. Include both unit and integration tests
